<p>Dreadball by Mantic Games</p>



<p>I love fantasy sports anything... well real Fantasy Sports. I used to play Blood Bowl and still play the PC version occasionally. There is something about Orcs and Dwarves smashing each other to the pitch that feels so... perfectly brutal. For years now, Blood Bowl has reigned supreme in its niche fantasy sports tabletop genre. For years now, Blood Bowl has left the pitch open for another team to take its place. Small publisher Mantic Games has risen to the challenge.</p>

<p>It has been no secret that Mantic Games has been gunning for Games Workshop in many ways. There's been a bit of frustration with long time fans on how GW has been handling their IPss. Rebooting the Warhammer Universe with Age of Sigmar and completely abandoning fantastic IPss as well. Mantic has been attempting to shoot and score where GW has been dropping the ball.</p>

<p>Almost 4 years ago, after a successful Kickstarter, Mantic Games launched Dreadball. At first glance, this looks just like a copy of Blood Bowl with a Sci Fi theme. While there are some similarities, they are two different games. Blood Bowl is like Rugby, Football, Soccer while Dreadball is like Basketball, Hockey, and “Jai alai.” </p>

<p>I can probably analyze for hours about the similarities and differences between BB and Dreadball. For this review I'll just go into some of the details on DB Season 1.</p>

<p>Dreadball features a hex based board with six players allowed on the pitch at time. Turns take place through rushes with 5 actions. A rush can end if a ball is scored, dropped or thrown at another player. There's no penalty for falling down or losing a SLAM. This keeps games of Dreadball tight, quick and brutal. As a player you’ll be planning out your actions ahead of time trying to maximize the chance you can scoring.</p>

<p>Dreadball doesn't feature just one scoring zone, but three (called Strike Hexes).  In addition, each strike hex has an "extra point zone" which a more difficult shot. It is also important to note when a team scores, players stay where they are; there’s no resets. This makes you constantly tactically think about where your players on the pitch all the time. </p>

<p>When it comes to the teams, you get some familiar classics, Humans, Orcs, Rats and Dwarves. Each team has varying strengths and weaknesses, but I would say for Season 1, that it's actually pretty balanced (I wish I could say the same for later seasons). I would say the Dwarves are underpowered in the fact that they are slow. Honestly good luck getting them up after falling. </p>

<p>My only real complaint is actually balance between the roles. There are three roles a player can have starting out: Striker, Jack and Guard. Strikers are generally quicker and better throwing / scoring and Guards are slamming powerhouses. Jacks are in the middle, but don't excel at either. Their lack of specialization makes them mediocre. Teams that rely on Jacks for scoring will generally be at a disadvantage against teams with Strikers. Only being able to move 1 space for slam / throw will hurt.</p>

<p>Mantic Games has done a fantastic job with Dreadball. It might have been created in the shadow of Blood Bowl, but exceeds the game in almost every respect. We'll be starting a league next week and look forward to the results. I can not recommend this game enough!</p>
