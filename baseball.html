<p>Baseball Highlights 2045 by Eagle-Gryphon Games</p>

<p>I'm actually not the biggest baseball fan. I casually follow some of my favorite players and enjoy going out to a few Oakland A's games during the season, but that's about it. </p>

<p>Baseball Highlights 2045 plays anywhere between one to four players. A game simulates a season of baseball that is played through 7-10 minute mini games. You will field your players to attempt hits and runs while countering their opponent. Players with the most runs will win the mini game. </p>

<p>Players then take their total "resource value" on each of their played cards to buy new players and send their mediocre players back to the minors. The new players are added to the top of their Lineup Deck where they'll be immediately used next game. </p>

<p>The base game features three different types of players: Robots, Cyborgs and Naturals. Robots are great at hitting and getting runners on base. Cyborgs are versatile and good at performing offensive abilities to push you runners forward. Naturals are great at catching (cancelling hits) before the runners even get a chance to get on base. </p>

<p>On the surface, the gameplay is simple. You play a card, resolve any of the offensive / defensive abilities and add the threated hitters on the bottom. Your opponent then does the same. The real depth comes from the drafting and deck building.</p>

<p>For every new player acquired in Baseball Highlights 2045, another player from the last round must be sent back to the minors (scrapped / trashed). Player decks will be small at a total of 15 cards. </p>

<p>The only real issue is that gameplay can feel punchy or involve too much of the "take that" mechanic for some players. I highly recommend buying the expansions. That aside, Baseball Highlights 2045 is currently by favorite sports and card game.</p>

<h4>Overall Rating: 9.5 / 10</h4>
