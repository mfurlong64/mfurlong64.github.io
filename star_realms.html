<p>Star Realms by White Wizard Games</p>


Yes I am late, but with the success of Star Realms, I feel like it was time to finally review it. I will also need to state that this is after at least 1,000 games of both the physical and digital versions with expansions.<p></p>

Star Realms is basically the compact sized, direct conflict cousin of Ascension with more direct player conflict. Both have a similar buy row. For Star Realms, instead racking up the victory points, the player's objective is run the opposing authority to zero.<p></p>

This game thrives off of abilities gained from synergies of similar factions. This allows players to pull of some very satisfying combos. Scrapping and cycling are also very important. A well constructed deck will be small with cards that draw. <p></p>

But, for 15 bucks this is a great two player game. Check out their website for more information at <a href="http://www.starrealms.com/">the Star Realms Official Website</a>!<p></p>

<h4>Overall Rating: 8 / 10</h4><p></p>
